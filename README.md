# Sigma-Rules-in-Splunk

**High Level Concept (HLC)**
“Sigma is for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is for files.”

**Solution**
It is built as an open-source standard so that a single Sigma detection rule can be used across the entire security landscape of SIEMs (Eg. Splunk, Azure Sentinel and more), logging platforms (Eg. greylog) and databases (Eg. MySQL).
